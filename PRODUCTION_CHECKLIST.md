# Production Readiness Checklist

## Database Migrations

All migrations must be applied in order:

1. `001_add_nested_albums.sql` - Adds parent_id for nested album structure
2. `002_add_featured_collections.sql` - Adds featured flags to collections, videos, and photos
3. `003_add_image_id_to_video_storyboard.sql` - Adds image_id to video storyboard items
4. `004_add_frontend_content.sql` - Creates hero, services, about, contact, and site settings tables

### How to Apply Migrations

```bash
# Using Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Or manually run each SQL file in the Supabase SQL Editor
```

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables in `.env` or `.env.local`:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Cloudinary Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# Admin Authentication
ADMIN_USERNAME=your_admin_username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password
```

## Pre-Deployment Steps

1. **Run Build Test**
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

2. **Test Admin Login**
   - Navigate to `/admin/login`
   - Verify authentication works
   - Test all CRUD operations

3. **Test Frontend Pages**
   - Homepage loads all featured content
   - Gallery shows all albums
   - Video page works with filters
   - About and Contact pages display correctly

4. **Check Environment Variables**
   - All required env vars are set in production
   - No .env files in git repository

5. **Database Health Check**
   - All migrations applied
   - RLS policies active
   - Tables have proper indexes
   - Sample data exists

6. **Performance Check**
   - Run Lighthouse audit
   - Check bundle size: `pnpm build` and review output
   - Verify images are optimized
   - Test loading speed on 3G/4G

## Deployment Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Start production server
pnpm start
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

1. Visit homepage and verify all sections load
2. Test admin login at `/admin/login`
3. Create/edit/delete content in admin
4. Verify featured content appears on homepage
5. Test mobile responsiveness
6. Check browser console for errors
7. Verify all images load from Cloudinary
8. Test video embeds (YouTube/Vimeo)

## Known Issues / Limitations

- Video storyboard requires manual image_id population (run script if needed)
- Contact form submissions need backend integration (currently frontend only)
- Admin authentication uses basic username/password (consider OAuth for production)

## Performance Targets

- Lighthouse Performance: > 90
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint: < 2.5s
- Time to Interactive: < 3.5s
- Cumulative Layout Shift: < 0.1

## Maintenance

- Regular Cloudinary storage cleanup
- Database backups via Supabase dashboard
- Monitor error logs
- Update dependencies monthly
- Review and optimize slow queries
